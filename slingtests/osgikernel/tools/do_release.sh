# This script will create a release candidate and tag it after a sucessfull build,  and leave the head version on the original version.
# all git commits will be to the local checked out branch, nothing will be pushed to the central repo. 
# once the RC tag has been created dont forget to push it up to the repo with a
# git push origin master
# git push origin tag 0.2-RC2
#
# Once a vote has taken place yo can retag the RC tag with a release tag
# git tag -s 0.2 <the SHa1 of the 0.2-RC2 tag>
#
# Command line options
#
# ./do_release [from version] [to version] [Release Candidate] [test files to ignore seperated by |] 
#
# Example: ./do_release.sh 0.2 0.3 RC2 kern-483.rb|kern-330.rb 
# This will create a release for version 0.3 tag it as 0.3-RC2 and then move back to 0.2-SNAPSHOT for developers
# It will ignore kern-485 and kern-330
