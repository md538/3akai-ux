This rare experience has helped me to develop a passion for anti-poverty efforts in my life and work. It is the reason I chose the profession of social work. I view social work as a vehicle to champion social justice and quality of life for all.</p><p>On the right, you can see my two foster sisters in 1998.</p><p>As a professional, I have concentrated my work in the areas of social policy and evaluation. From my personal and professional experiences, it has become evident that the social ills of our nation are rooted in our social systems. Because policies create and shape our social systems and institutions, I believe it is essential to be involved with policymaking. Furthermore, I want to have the greatest impact as possible in creating significant social change. Therefore, I need to be at the table when crucial policy decisions are being made. Additionally, I believe my commitment to evaluation and a thorough understanding of research methodology will help me in creating and supporting the most effective programs and policies as possible throughout my career.</p></div>"
