httpd.conf: should be appended to the end of your existing apache2.2 httpd.conf file.
nightly.sh: shell script used to build and run the nightly instances of hybrid mode (i.e. Sakai 2+3).
server.xml: The tomcat5.5.x config used to bind tomcat to non-default ports to avoid conflict with K2 ports.

Notes
-----
1) For nightly.sh to work, you must have apache-tomcat-5.5.26.tar.gz in $BUILD_DIR.  I a copy you can download from here:
https://www.slashtmp.iu.edu/public/download.php?FILE=lance/61215FNL7uy

2) To install apache2.2 on Mac OS X, I used MacPorts; see:
http://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/KERNDOC/Installing+git

Then install apache2 using the following command:
sudo port install apache2 +no_startupitem

I then have an alias I use for starting and stopping apache (this avoids the apache 1.3.x installed with Mac OS X):
alias apache2ctl='sudo /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl'

For example: apache2ctl start; apache2ctl stop; apache2ctl restart

3) To add the necessary proxy settings to your apache2.2 config: add the directives from ./httpd.conf to the end of and stop/start or restart apache2:
/opt/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

4) The server.xml from ./server.xml also needs to replace the one in $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml (just to bind to different ports than k2). The ./nightly.sh performs this step for you, so this is just an FYI.
